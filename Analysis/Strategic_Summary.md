# Strategic Summary: Park City Real Estate Google Ads

This report synthesizes the key findings from our analysis of 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year Google Trends data to provide a clear, actionable strategy for Google Ads campaigns.

## Key Trend Observations

By comparing the different timeframes, we've identified several key shifts in the market:

*   **Emerging Luxury Markets:** Themes like **Victory Ranch** and **Red Ledges** show significant growth in the 1- and 2-year data compared to the 5-year baseline. This indicates a growing interest in newer, high-end developments.
*   **Sustained Broad Interest:** Core terms like **Park City Real Estate** and **Deer Valley Real Estate** remain the highest volume searches across all timeframes, confirming their foundational importance.
*   **Shifting Geographic Focus:** While Salt Lake City remains a dominant source of search traffic, there is a noticeable increase in interest from major out-of-state metros like **Los Angeles**, **New York**, and **Dallas** in the more recent 1- and 2-year data.

## Recommended Campaign Structure

Based on the multi-year analysis, we recommend the following strategic campaign structure:

1.  **Campaign: "Always-On" Core Markets (High Budget)**
    *   **Themes:** `Park City Real Estate`, `Deer Valley Real Estate`, `Heber Utah Real Estate`.
    *   **Rationale:** These are the bedrock of the market. This campaign should run year-round to capture consistent, high-volume traffic. Ad groups should target both local (Salt Lake City) and major national metros.

2.  **Campaign: Emerging Luxury Developments (Medium, Growth-Focused Budget)**
    *   **Themes:** `Victory Ranch`, `Red Ledges`, `Promontory`, `Glenwild`.
    *   **Rationale:** This is where the market is heading. This campaign should focus on capturing high-intent, affluent buyers. Targeting should be heavily weighted towards the top out-of-state metros (LA, NY, Dallas, Chicago).

3.  **Campaign: Seasonal & Lifestyle (Flexible, Seasonal Budget)**
    *   **Themes:** `Ski in Ski Out Home for Sale`, `Kamas Real Estate`.
    *   **Rationale:** These themes are highly seasonal. This campaign should be activated with an increased budget during peak seasons (e.g., winter for ski properties, summer for Kamas) to maximize ROI.

## Final Strategic Recommendations

*   **Action 1: Prioritize High-Growth, High-Value Keywords.**
    *   Allocate a significant portion of your budget to the "Emerging Luxury Developments" campaign. The data shows this is the fastest-growing segment of the market.

*   **Action 2: Implement Geo-Targeted Ad Copy.**
    *   Create specific ad copy for the top 5 metro areas. For example: "Los Angeles, find your Park City dream home" or "Exclusive Deer Valley listings for New York buyers." This personalization will increase click-through rates.

*   **Action 3: Align Ad Scheduling with Peak Seasonality.**
    *   Use the seasonality data to create an aggressive ad schedule that increases bids and budgets during the peak weeks for each thematic campaign. For ski properties, this means a heavy focus on December and January. For general real estate, late summer is key.

By adopting this data-driven strategy, you can more effectively allocate your budget, reach the right buyers with the right message, and stay ahead of the evolving market trends in Park City real estate.
